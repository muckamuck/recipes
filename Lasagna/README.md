Apologies for the oversight; here's a concise recipe for making a small batch of lasagna, which should serve about 2-4 people depending on portion size:

#### Ingredients:
* Lasagna Noodles: 6-8 sheets (depending on your dish size)
* Meat Sauce:
  * 1/2 lb ground beef or Italian sausage (or mix)
  * 1/2 small onion, finely chopped
  * 1 clove garlic, minced
  * 1 cup tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes
  * 1/2 tsp each of oregano, basil, salt, pepper
* Cheese Mixture:
  * 1 cup ricotta cheese
  * 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella (some for topping)
  * 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  * 1 egg
  * Salt and pepper to taste
* Additional Mozzarella: for topping

#### Equipment:
* An 8x8 inch baking dish or similar smaller pan
* Skillet for sauce
* Bowl for mixing cheese

#### Instructions:
* Preheat Oven: Set to 375°F (190°C).
* Cook Noodles: 
  * Cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and lay flat to cool.
* Make the Meat Sauce:
  * Cook meat in skillet until browned. Drain fat.
  * Add onion and garlic, cook until onions soften.
  * Add tomato sauce and spices, simmer for 10 minutes.
* Cheese Mixture:
  * Combine ricotta, most of the mozzarella, Parmesan, egg, salt, and pepper.
* Assemble Lasagna:
  * Spread a bit of sauce on the bottom of the dish.
  * Place noodles, then half the cheese mixture, then meat sauce. Repeat.
  * End with noodles, a layer of sauce, and top with remaining mozzarella.
* Bake:
  * Cover with foil, bake for 25 minutes. 
  * Remove foil, bake another 10-15 minutes until cheese is bubbly and golden.
* Rest: Let lasagna sit for 10 minutes post-baking to set.
* Serve: Cut into portions and serve, perhaps with a side salad or bread.

#### Notes:
No-boil noodles can be used; adjust liquid content accordingly.

You can add spinach or other veggies to the cheese mixture for variety.

If using cottage cheese instead of ricotta, blend it for a smoother texture.

This small batch should give you the lasagna experience without an overwhelming amount of leftovers. Enjoy!
