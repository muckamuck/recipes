### Quick and Easy Instant Pot Pulled Pork

#### Ingredients:
* 3-4 lbs pork shoulder (butt), cut into 2-3 inch chunks (no need to be precise)
* 1 tablespoon oil (for sautéing)
* 1 cup chicken broth, beef broth, or water (for moisture and deglazing)
* 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar (for a tangy kick)
* 1-2 tablespoons brown sugar (optional, for sweetness)
* 1 tablespoon smoked paprika (for that smoky flavor)
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Your favorite BBQ sauce (about 1-2 cups, added after cooking)

#### Steps:
* Prep the Pork: Trim excess fat if you like, then cut the pork into chunks.
* Season generously with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.
* Sear (Optional but Worth It): Set your Instant Pot to "Sauté" mode, add the oil, and brown the pork chunks on all sides (about 2-3 minutes per side). This locks in flavor. Work in batches if needed, then remove the pork and set it aside.
* Deglaze: Pour the broth and apple cider vinegar into the pot. Scrape up the browned bits from the bottom with a wooden spoon—this is flavor gold.
* Pressure Cook: Return the pork to the pot. Seal the lid, set the valve to "Sealing," and cook on High Pressure for 45 minutes. (For a 4-lb roast, 45-50 minutes works; adjust slightly for smaller cuts.)
* Natural Release: Let the pressure release naturally for 15-20 minutes before switching the valve to "Venting" to release any remaining pressure.
* Shred: Remove the pork to a bowl and shred it with two forks. It should fall apart easily. Discard any large fat pieces if you prefer.

#### Finish with Sauce:
* Mix in your BBQ sauce (start with 1 cup, add more to taste) and a few spoonfuls of the cooking liquid for extra juiciness.
* If you want a caramelized touch, spread the pork on a baking sheet and broil for 3-5 minutes after saucing.


The Secret Sauce (Not Literally): The pressure cooker mimics hours of slow cooking by breaking down the collagen in the pork shoulder in under an hour. The vinegar tenderizes and adds depth, while the broth keeps it moist. Searing isn’t mandatory, but it’s the difference between good and great pulled pork.
Serve it on buns, with coleslaw, or just eat it straight. You’ll never go back to the slow cooker once you nail this. Enjoy!
