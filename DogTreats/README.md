Baking treats for your dog with peanut butter is a wonderful way to spoil them with some homemade goodies. Here's a simple and dog-safe recipe you can try at home. Remember, when choosing peanut butter, always select a brand that is free from xylitol, a sweetener that is toxic to dogs.

### Peanut Butter Dog Treats Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- 2 cups of whole wheat flour (you can substitute with oat flour or rice flour for dogs with wheat allergies)
- 1/2 cup of oats
- 1/4 cup of unsweetened peanut butter
- 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce or mashed banana
- 1/2 cup of water (you may need a bit more to form a dough)
- 1 teaspoon of baking powder

#### Instructions:

1. **Preheat Oven**: Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, mix the whole wheat flour, oats, and baking powder.

3. **Add Wet Ingredients**: Add the peanut butter and applesauce (or mashed banana) to the dry ingredients. Begin to mix everything together. Gradually add in the water until the mixture forms a dough. The dough should be firm and not sticky. You might need to adjust the amount of water slightly, depending on the consistency.

4. **Roll and Cut Out Treats**: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/4 inch thick. Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes or simply cut the dough into small squares with a knife.

5. **Bake**: Place the treats on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crisp.

6. **Cool Down**: Let the treats cool completely on a wire rack before serving them to your dog.

7. **Storage**: Store the cooled treats in an airtight container for up to a week or in the refrigerator for up to three weeks.

This simple recipe can be customized in many ways to suit your dog's taste or dietary needs. For example, you can add a couple of tablespoons of pumpkin puree (make sure it's plain pumpkin, not pie filling) for an extra tasty and fiber-rich treat.

Remember, treats should only make up a small portion of your dog's diet. Always consult with your vet if you're unsure about introducing new foods into your dog's diet.
